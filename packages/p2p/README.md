# Replicators / p2p

Note -- this is a demonstration replicator that relies on a very simple protocol for exchanging data between peers.

[todomvc-p2p](https://github.com/vlcn-io/live-examples/tree/main/src/todomvc-p2p) has example use of this replicator. Note that this layer requires a [peerjs](https://peerjs.com/) signaling server.
